# powers

The goal of the powers package is to make the computation of powers easier. There are built in functions to allow you to compute the square or cube of a vector, or compute an exponent of your choice. 

To load the powers use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("KateJohnson/powers")
```

Once the package is loaded, you can see a short description of powers using:

```{r}
library(powers)
?powers
```

And the full vignette using:

```{r}
??"powers vignette"
```


## Examples

There are three functions that are part of this package. 

```{r}
pow(2,3)
square(2)
cube(3)
```

*Note:* This is a practice package for STAT 547, you can seem my reflections on that assignment (**for reviewers**) [here](https://github.com/KateJohnson/powers/blob/master/STAT547README.md)
